<p>The family was conceived by Groening shortly before a solicitation for a series of <a

    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_L._Brooks">James L. Brooks</a>. He created a <a

    named the characters after his own family members,
    substituting Bart for his own name; he thought Simpson was a funny name in that it sounded similar to

            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons#cite_note-6">[4]</a></sup> The shorts became a part of <a

        Tracey Ullman Show</a> on April 19, 1987. After three seasons, the
    sketch was developed into a half-hour prime time show and became Fox's first series to land in the Top 30 ratings in
    a season (1989–1990).</p>
