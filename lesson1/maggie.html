<h1>Maggie</h1>
<img src="img/Maggie_Simpson.png" alt="Maggie"/>
<p>Margaret Evelyn Lenny "Maggie" Simpson is a fictional character in the animated television series The Simpsons
    and a part of the Simpson family, notably the youngest member. She first appeared on television in the Tracey Ullman
    Show short "Good Night" on April 19, 1987. Maggie was created and designed by cartoonist Matt Groening while he was
    waiting in the lobby of James L. Brooks' office. She received her first name from Groening's youngest sister. After
    appearing on The Tracey Ullman Show for three years, the Simpson family was given their own series on the Fox
    Broadcasting Company which debuted December 17, 1989.</p>
<p>Maggie is the youngest child of Homer and Marge, and the younger sister to Bart and Lisa. She is often seen sucking
    on her orange pacifier and, when she walks, she trips over her clothing and falls on her face (this running gag is
    used much more in earlier seasons). Being an infant, she has not yet learned how to talk. However, she did appear to
    talk in the first Tracey Ullman Show short.</p>
<p>Though she rarely talks, she frequently makes a characteristic sucking noise with her pacifier, which has become
    synonymous with the character. Her pacifier sucking noises are provided by the show's creator, Matt Groening, and
    early producer Gábor Csupó. Maggie's occasional speaking parts and other vocalizations are currently provided by
    Nancy Cartwright, but she has also been voiced by guest stars Carol Kane, James Earl Jones, Elizabeth Taylor and
    Jodie Foster, and by series regulars Yeardley Smith and Harry Shearer. Maggie has appeared in various media relating
    to The Simpsons – including video games, The Simpsons Movie, The Simpsons Ride, commercials and comic books – and
    has inspired an entire line of merchandise.</p>
