<h1>Homer</h1>

<p>Homer Jay Simpson is a fictional character and the main protagonist of the American animated sitcom The Simpsons.
    He is voiced by Dan Castellaneta and first appeared, along with the rest of his family, in The Tracey Ullman Show
    short "Good Night" on April 19, 1987. Homer was created and designed by cartoonist Matt Groening while he was
    waiting in the lobby of producer James L. Brooks's office. Groening had been called to pitch a series of shorts
    based on his comic strip Life in Hell but instead decided to create a new set of characters. He named the character
    after his father, Homer Groening. After appearing for three seasons on The Tracey Ullman Show, the Simpson family
    got their own series on Fox, which debuted December 17, 1989. The show was later acquired by Disney in 2019.</p>
<p>As the nominal foreman of the paternally eponymous family, Homer and his wife Marge have three children: Bart, Lisa
    and Maggie. As the family's provider, he works at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant as safety inspector. Homer
    embodies many American working class stereotypes: he is obese, immature, outspoken, aggressive, balding, lazy,
    ignorant, unprofessional, and fond of beer, junk food and watching television. However, he is fundamentally a good
    man and is staunchly protective of his family, especially when they need him the most. Despite the suburban
    blue-collar routine of his life, he has had a number of remarkable experiences, including going to space, climbing
    the tallest mountain in Springfield by himself, fighting former President George H. W. Bush, and winning a Grammy
    Award as a member of a barbershop quartet.</p>
<p>In the shorts and earlier episodes, Castellaneta voiced Homer with a loose impression of Walter Matthau; however,
    during the second and third seasons of the half-hour show, Homer's voice evolved to become more robust, to allow the
    expression of a fuller range of emotions. He has appeared in other media relating to The Simpsons—including video
    games, The Simpsons Movie, The Simpsons Ride, commercials, and comic books—and inspired an entire line of
    merchandise. His signature catchphrase, the annoyed grunt "D'oh!", has been included in The New Oxford Dictionary of
    English since 1998 and the Oxford English Dictionary since 2001.</p>
